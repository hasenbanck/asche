Provides an abstraction layer above erupt to easier use Vulkan in Rust.

## Requirements

Vulkan 1.2.

Used features:

- "buffer device address"
- "timeline_semaphores"

## Status

Under heavy development.

## Should you use this crate?

No. I don't have a clear vision for this crate yet. Right now it's a building block for my own
Vulkan based engine, which will replace an older WGPU renderer.
